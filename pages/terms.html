    <p>Welcome to HTML Editor PRO. By accessing or using our app, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully before using the app.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Use of the App</h2>
    <p>Our app provides tools for creating and editing web code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and previewing the result live. You agree to use the app for lawful, ethical, and non-malicious purposes only.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Account Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and any code you upload. You agree not to upload content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, or violates intellectual property rights.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Code Uploads and GitHub Integration</h2>
    <p>Any code you upload through the app is stored securely in a private GitHub repository managed by us. While the repository is private, code you upload may be publicly viewable via browser rendering features (such as preview iframes).</p>
    <p>You retain ownership of your code, but you grant us permission to store, process, and render it as needed for the app to function properly.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Content Preview and Public Rendering</h2>
    <p>By uploading and rendering code, you understand that parts of your content may be accessible in a rendered form through URLs (e.g., <code>/view/uid/filename</code>). Do not upload sensitive data or proprietary code.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Modifications and Updates</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue any part of the app, including these Terms and Conditions, at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the app constitutes your acceptance of any changes.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>We are not responsible for any loss, misuse, or exposure of code uploaded to the platform. You are solely responsible for the legality and safety of the content you upload and render.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the app at any time if you are found violating these Terms, using the app for illegal purposes, or compromising system integrity.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, please reach out via our <a href="contact.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
