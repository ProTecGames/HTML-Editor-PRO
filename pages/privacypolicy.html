  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>We, ProTec Games, the administration of this app, value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. When you sign up and use this app, we collect and store certain data to provide you with the intended services.</p>
  <p>The information collected includes your email address, which is only visible to us. We may use this email address to reach out to you for promotional purposes or to provide assistance related to the app.</p>

  <h2>Code Storage and Background Saving</h2>
  <p>All code you create or edit using the appâ€™s built-in editor is automatically saved in the background without requiring manual action or confirmation. You may not see a visible indication that your code is being stored; however, this functionality is an intentional part of the app's design.</p>
  <p>All saved code is securely stored in a private GitHub repository managed by us and may be organized by your user ID and filename. Rendered previews of code (e.g., HTML output) may be viewable via iframe-based previews within the app.</p>
  <p>By using the app, you consent to this background saving of your work. We do not share your code with any third parties beyond the storage and rendering services described here.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We take appropriate measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of your data. All user data, including uploaded or auto-saved code and collaboration, is securely stored either on our systems or trusted platforms such as GitHub. Only authorized administration has access to this data.</p>

  <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
  <p>If you wish to delete your account and all associated data, including saved code, please contact us using the support channels provided. Upon verification, your data will be promptly removed from our systems and repositories.</p>

  <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
  <p>We analyze data such as time spent on the app, usage patterns, features used, and ad views. This helps us improve user experience and plan future updates.</p>

  <h2>Ads Preference</h2>
  <p>We serve ads using Google AdMob. Information about your interaction with ads may be collected by Google as part of their ad services. Refer to their privacy policy for full details.</p>

  <h2>Email Preference</h2>
  <p>By signing up for our app, you consent to being added to our Google Group for communication purposes. You may unsubscribe from these emails at any time.</p>

  <h2>Payment Method</h2>
  <p>Payments are currently accepted via Google Play in-app purchases and PayPal. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information on how your payment data is handled.</p>

  <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Updates will be posted on this page. Continued use of the app after any changes means you accept the updated terms.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>
